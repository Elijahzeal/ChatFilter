# ChatFilter
A chat filter plugin designed for spigot servers.
The latest edition of the Microsoft moderation changes coming to minecraft with 1.19 brings a way for them to moderate users on the game externally.
This chat filter should benefit server owners to filter unwanted language from their servers; whether that be swearing, slurs or other unwanted vocabulary, allowing chat to be family friendly.
